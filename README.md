# RSA-implement

## RSA - Encryption 
* The objective is to use public key (n,e) and message (m) to compute the ciphertext (c).

## RSA - Decryption
* The objective is to use public key (n,e) and ciphertext (c) to break RSA cryptography and compute message (m)

PS. i didn't use any libraries to have short-cut. I implement my own modular exponentiation function.
